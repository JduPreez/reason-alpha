## Concepts

### Entities

* An entity is a type of thing.

* In the UI when working with the data collection of a type of entity, the plural name is used.

* In the rest API the plural name of the type of entity is used.

* When working with a single entity, all its keys are namespaced with the singular type of the entity.
